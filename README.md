# Predicting Shelter Availability in Toronto

## Overview

This project aims to predict the availability of shelter beds in Toronto using a machine learning model trained on historical shelter occupancy data and weather conditions. With shelter occupancy rates often reaching 100%, predicting availability as a binary (Y/N) variable presents a practical challenge. By integrating features such as temperature, weather conditions, holidays, and other relevant factors, the model will address the imbalanced nature of the data and provide valuable insights for resource allocation and planning. Additionally, the project explores methods for generalizing the model to other districts, laying the groundwork for potential scalability and wider applicability.

## Usage

[Instructions on how to use the project, including any necessary commands and parameters.]

## Data

The project utilizes historical shelter occupancy data provided by the City of Toronto, available at [link], and weather data from [source]. The datasets are preprocessed to handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and feature engineering.

## Methodology

The methodology involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using algorithms designed to handle imbalanced data are applied. Model performance is assessed using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
