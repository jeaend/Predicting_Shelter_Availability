# Predictiong_Shelter_Availability
Using historical shelter occupancy data and weather conditions, this project develops a machine learning model to predict shelter bed availability. Addressing the challenge of imbalanced data, it integrates factors like temperature, offering insights for resource planning. Generalization to other districts is explored for wider applicability.
