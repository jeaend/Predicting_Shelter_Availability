# Data

This directory contains the raw and processed data used in the project.

The shelter occupancy data was sourced from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal. You can find the dataset [here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-overnight-service-occupancy-capacity/).

The climate data for Toronto City from January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2024, was obtained from the Climate Data Canada website. You can download the data for Toronto City from the [Climate Data Canada website](https://climatedata.ca/download/#station-download) using the specified parameters. 

This climate data will be used to analyze weather conditions and their impact on shelter occupancy rates.
